            with camera rolling<br>
            standing <br>
            on a hedge<br>
            on some grass<br>
            on on a street<br>
            in a woodland<br>
            in an industrial park<br>
            somewhere in or around Limerick, Ireland<br>
            looking<br>
            this thing i’ve found myself doing<br>
            a kind of ritual –<br>
            spending time<br>
            gawping<br>
            waiting for the landscape <br>to reveal things to me
        </p>

            and there are many times more
            where I choose not to lug my camera along with me.
            the goal wouldn’t exactly be to mediatise it all anyway would it?
            it’s more about practising a way of living, seeing 
            and y’know in a way I suppose, amn’t I glad to be out and about<br>
            all the same<br>
            roaming the homeland<br>
            isn’t that it<br>
            gawping <br>

        <p>when I’m looking <br>
            I see things like<br>
            buildings (lots of kinds) -
            some are houses, others workplaces -
            manufacturing plants, waste facilities, offices -
            and infrastructural things -
            that make humming noises and have weird smells -
            like stuff for water and electricity probably -
            roads, big ones small ones medium ones -
            fields, agriculture, lots of cattle -
            hedges fences walls ditches dikes -
            rivers and streams running at their speeds -
            branches blowing about the place -
            all quite normal stuff really -
            and isn't that the point?</p>

            some placenames: Kiltanna, Kilcoleman, Rathkeale, Castlematrix, Aughinish Alumina, Ballycar, Parteen, National Technology Park, Cratloe, Gortadroma, Keeper Hill, Ardnacrusha, Cruise’s Street, O’Callaghan Strand, Lough Gur, Annacotty Business Park
            <br>
            <br>    
            I've had a long relationship
            with many of these places.
            their images are furnished
            with personal memories and meaning -
            like all the times I stood on the sideline
            at the local GAA pitch,
            or when I stayed in the village messing
            when the school bus didn’t come during snow,
            or from the window at home every morning,
            seeing the Aughinish smokestacks rising in the distance -<br>
            but that’s just me

            now I begin to feel something<br>
            maybe as my blood calms,
            and my senses slowly open<br>
            and instead of being a coloniser/voyeur
            with my video camera -
            I am a constituent part of the landscape <br>
<br>
            the landscape offers up
            artefacts, characteristics, traces,
            remnants of past (it’s all a remnant of past isn’t it?) -
            fragments of future.<br>
            the landscape unfolds its many layers -
            it presents in a haunted flux state - 
            an unnavigable tangled dynamic of potential pasts and futures,
            making up present reality -
            things which occurred that will occur again -
            somehow (must they?)<br>
            all the tragedies and oppressions and hardships
            I don’t need to name
            that permeate Irish consciousness - <br>
            and the joy and glory days <br>
            dancing and music,
            feasting and jubilation, 
            rewarding hard work,
            friendship and meitheal<br>
            <br>
            the land holds multiplicities -
            many-voiced (human and non-human) -
            some you hear, babbling to eternity<br>
            many held down deep<br>
            bogsunk mem’ry<br>
            secrets devour’d by worms<br>

            I’m quick to think of the landscape as human culture -
            landscape as a stage for human dramas to unfold,
            writ with layers of human story.
            and I think of our agency over the land - <br>
            our exploitation of it <br>
            our poisoning of it<br>
            the sick land<br>
            disaster spelled for the future -
            how might we change tactic -
            how might care for the sick land?<br>
            <br>
            but here, taking note of the land as it appears to be,
            it doesn’t necessarily appear overtly fussed about human culture.
            some buildings I see are as yet only half-built,
            many others I see are neglected and forgotten -
            becoming reclaimed by creeping mosses and plants
            and insects and birds and the odd rat no doubt.
            all are works-in-progress.<br>
            without us, things carry on nonetheless<br>
            things will change<br>
            <br>
            we can draw as many dividing lines as we like
            across the surface of the land -
            but despite our best efforts, the land cannot be owned<br>
            we are not its master<br>
            the land is unownable<br>
            we do not write its history<br>
            the landscape is beyond us

            staring<br>
            staring at the landscape <br>
            gawping at the landscape <br>
            until time becomes liquid<br>
            <br>
            plant landscape, animal landscape, voice of fungus and bacterium and virus, and human. <br>
            long ago it probably used to have different animals<br>
            like cows that look a bit funny or different<br>
            or butterflies that were massive<br>
            and the humans<br>
            I think of the old Irish pagans and
            how I like their idea of a cyclical time, moving thru the seasons - 
            and I think of them eating all different kinds of mushrooms 
            and having mad psychedelic sensuous experiences,
            where they felt deeply connected to a more than human landscape,
            and drew mad spiral shapes on stones.
            I’d be interested to hear what kind of sounds they made -
            maybe they still echo, too<br>
            <br>
            and do I long for some kind of regression into tribalism -
            is that what this is all about?
            would that solve whatever problems I think there are?
            for now, I’m not sure how that can happen -
            with us having starbucks and iPads and all<br>
            but anyway<br>
            I quietly reach over<br>
            and press 'stop record'<br>
